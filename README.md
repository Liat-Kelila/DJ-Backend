# DJ-Backend

This is a full stack CRUD app using Go as the language of choice for the backend, and using Postgres for the database. Gorm was a library used in order to communicate between Go and Postgres. Much time was spent exploring different resoures and deciding which ones were most helpful to use. Was quite the adventure learning a new technology - overcame obstacles such as CORS handling, decoding and encoding to translate Go into JSON, so communication to and from the frontend could successfully occur. 

Deploying to Heroku was a challenge not yet overcome, due to the postgres configuration requirements using Go and Heroku's specific needs for deployment. In the future, I would deploy earlier on so that my database was always publicly hosted, as it does not help the cause to have a fully functioning application only on the local system.

Otherwise, I think Go was a nice language to work with and I look forward to working with it more in the future.
